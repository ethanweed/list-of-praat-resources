# List of Praat resources

I'm often looking for information on Praat, either for myself or for my teaching. This is a running list of resources that I have found useful. Contributions are welcome!

## Praat and Praat scripting:


Great UCLA Praat script repository (so much Praat stuff!):
http://phonetics.linguistics.ucla.edu/facilities/acoustic/praat.html#pictures

The Praat manual. Almost never the place to start, but sometimes the only place you will find what you are looking for. But you will have to look.
https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Intro.html

Praat's own list of Praat tutorials: https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manualsByOthers.html

Using Praat for Linguistic Research by Will Styler (including an 85+ pdf showing you how to do stuff in Praat, which is a testimony to how inscrutable the actual Praat manual is)
https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/praat/

Phonetics on Speed (Praat scripting tutorial by JÃ¶rg Mayer)
https://praatscripting.lingphon.net/variables-1.html

Praat scripting for dummies (Praat scripting tutorial by Shigeto Kawahara)
http://user.keio.ac.jp/~kawahara/pdf/PraatScriptingDummies.pdf

Praat scripting tutorial by Eleanor Chodroff
http://www.eleanorchodroff.com/tutorial/PraatScripting.pdf

Github repo with Praat scripting tutorials by Thea Knowles:
https://github.com/thealk/Praat_tutorials/tree/master

Praat for beginners, by Sidney Wood. SWPhonetics (lots of other interesting phonetics and non-phonetics stuff here too, very much worth checking out)
https://swphonetics.com/praat/

The best Praat scripting tutorial (100% guarantee). I don't know who this person is, but they are doing God's work. This is the most thorough and readable introduction to learning to script Praat that I have found. In my opinion, if you only look at one of these, make it this one:

## Python resources:

Plotting vowels with Python:

More plotting vowels with Python and Seaborn:

Textgridtools. Use Python to deal with textgrids, so you don't have to open Praat:
https://textgridtools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Parselmouth. Probably the most complete attempt at making it possible to use Praat without actually using Praat:
https://parselmouth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
